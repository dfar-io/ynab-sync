Collects data using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and then adjusts
different accounts using the [YNAB API](https://api.youneedabudget.com/).

## Getting Started

This app is set up using
[VSCode Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers),
so build the container using the development container to get started without
needing any dependencies.

provided in `.env.example`.
